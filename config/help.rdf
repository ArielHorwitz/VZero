=== Gameplay
On the [b]home[/b] screen, you can explore the world and the available encounters.
~
Pick an encounter, draft your abilities and play to kill the boss without losing your Fort.
If you win, you will get the [b]Victory Point[/b] reward. Beware, encounters cost you silver!


--- Version
This help section has been updated to the [i]base game of version [b]0.017[/b][/i]


=== World
The world map shows you all the available encounters. Each encounter will have a variable:
~
» [b]Map[/b] - determines the monsters and bosses
» [b]Difficulty[/b] - determines how many stocks you start with
» [b]Victory Point[/b] reward
~
You can usually only play an encounter once, win or lose.

--- Sandbox
The sandbox maps can be replayed without consequence.
~
Use the sandbox maps to test abilities and loadouts.


=== Encounter
You can usually only play an encounter once, win or lose. Win by killing the boss, lose if your Fort dies or you die.
~
The map's difficulty will determine how many stocks you have. Having extra stocks will allow you to respawn without losing.
~
Looting dead monsters and buying items from a shop is critical to success. Once in an encounter your abilities are set, but items allow you to customize any loadout.
~
Items will give you stats (that make you or your abilities stronger), and new abilities as well.
While this will vary by loadout, the [b]networth[/b] indicator is a good measure for how strong you are.

--- Monsters
Monsters generally fall in to one of the following categories:
~
» [b]Campers[/b] - territorial and aggressive. Most common source of gold.
» [b]Creeps[/b] - aggressive waves, intent on destroying your Fort.
» [b]Treasures[/b] - passive and difficult to crack, but yield much gold.
» [b]Neutrals[/b] - passive and usually offer some service, like an item shop.


=== Mechanics
Most mechanics are represented by both a [i]stat[/i] and a [i]status[/i]. Add them together to get the final value.
A [b]stat[/b] is a permanent value that is affected by regen, steal, or bonuses from abilities and items.
A [b]status[/b] is a temporary value that is added to the stat for a limited time.

--- Scaling
Many mechanics use [i]scaling values[/i] - which is simply a way to convert any number to a [b]%[/b]. Scaling values have a [i]minimum[/i] value, [i]maximum[/i] value, and [i]curve[/i]. The curve determines how quickly the value approaches 100%.

Mechanics always use a curve of [b]§ 50[/b]. See the scaling tables for detailed graphs.
--- Stats and Statuses
[b]Stocks[/b] - number of lives left.
~
[b]Shop[/b] - determines what tier items you have access to. You can buy any item tier at or below your shop value. Items can be sold with any shop value.
~
[b]Line of Sight (LOS)[/b] - determines how far you can see other units.
~
[b]Darkness[/b] - scaling value that reduces LOS. E.g. 50 darkness will reduce LOS by 50%.
~
[b]Movespeed[/b] - scaling value that determines how fast you walk. E.g. 50 movespeed equates to 250 units/second. The max movespeed is 500.
~
[b]Bounded[/b] - prevents any movement. The value doesn't matter (normally set to 1 or nothing).
~
[b]Slow[/b] - scaling value that inhibits movespeed. E.g. a unit with 50 slow will have reduced movespeed by 50%.
~
[b]Cuts[/b] - adds damage to any instance of normal damage taken. E.g. if a unit with 10 cuts gets hit by an attack with 30 normal damage, the unit will take 40 pure damage. See [i]damage types[/i].
~
[b]Armor[/b] - scaling value that reduces damage taken by any instance of normal damage. E.g. if a unit with 50 armor gets hit by an attack with 10 normal damage, the unit will take 5 pure damage. See [i]damage types[/i].
~
[b]Spikes[/b] - returns damage for any instance of normal damage taken. E.g. if a unit with 10 spikes gets hit by an attack with 50 normal damage, the unit will take 50 pure damage and the attacker will take 10 pure damage. See [i]damage types[/i].
~
[b]Lifesteal[/b] - % value that heals the attacker for any instance of normal damage given. E.g. if a unit with 50 lifesteal (50%) attacks for 10 normal damage, the attacker will heal 5 HP. See [i]damage types[/i].
~
[b]Vanity[/b] - % value that amplifies the damage of any instance of blast damage taken. E.g. if a unit with 50 vanity (50%) gets hit by an attack with 50 blast damage, the unit will take 75 pure damage. See [i]damage types[/i].
~
[b]Reflect[/b] - % value that returns damage for any instance of blast damage taken. E.g. if a unit with 50 reflect (50%) gets hit by an attack with 60 blast damage, the unit will take 60 pure damage and the attacker will take 30 pure damage. See [i]damage types[/i].
~
[b]Sensitivity[/b] - scaling value that amplifies incoming and outgoing status effects. E.g. if a unit with 30 sensitivity applies a status of 100 slow to a unit with 20 sensitivity (50 combined sensitivity), the unit will get a status of 150 slow. For mechanics that value means nothing (like bounded), the duration is amplified instead.

=== Damage Types
--- Pure Damage
Pure damage is the final amount of hp to reduce. All damage types are converted to pure damage.

--- Normal Damage
~Normal damage is a damage type that generally scales with Physical. When applying normal damage, follow this algorithm:
» Add the target's [i]cuts[/i] to the damage value
» Reduce damage value by the target's [i]armor[/i] (as %)
» Deal that damage as pure damage to the target
» Return the target's [i]spikes[/i] as pure damage to the attacker
» Heal the attacker by the attacker's [i]lifesteal[/i] (as %)

--- Blast Damage
~Blast damage is a damage type that generally scales with Fire. When applying blast damage, follow this algorithm:
» Add the target's [i]vanity[/i] to the damage value (as %)
» Deal that damage as pure damage to the target
» Return the target's [i]reflect[/i] as pure damage to the attacker (as %)
