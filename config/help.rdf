=== Gameplay
On the [b]home[/b] screen, you can explore the world and the available encounters.
~
Pick an encounter, draft your abilities and play to kill the boss without losing your Fort.
If you win, you will get the [b]Victory Point[/b] reward. Beware, encounters cost you silver!


--- Version
This help section has been updated to the [i]base game of version [b]0.016[/b][/i]


=== World
The world map shows you all the available encounters. Each encounter will have a variable:
~
» [b]Map[/b] - determines the monsters and bosses
» [b]Difficulty[/b] - determines how many stocks you start with
» [b]Victory Point[/b] reward
~
You can usually only play an encounter once, win or lose.

--- Sandbox
The sandbox maps can be replayed without consequence.
~
Use the sandbox maps to test abilities and loadouts.


=== Encounter
You can usually only play an encounter once, win or lose. Win by killing the boss, lose if your Fort dies or you die.
~
The map's difficulty will determine how many stocks you have. Having extra stocks will allow you to respawn without losing.
~
Looting dead monsters and buying items from a shop is critical to success. Once in an encounter your abilities are set, but items allow you to customize any loadout.
~
Items will give you stats (that make you or your abilities stronger), and new abilities as well.
While this will vary by loadout, the [b]networth[/b] indicator is a good measure for how strong you are.

--- Monsters
Monsters generally fall in to one of the following categories:
~
» [b]Campers[/b] - territorial and aggressive. Most common source of gold.
» [b]Creeps[/b] - aggressive waves, intent on destroying your Fort.
» [b]Treasures[/b] - passive and difficult to crack, but yield much gold.
» [b]Neutrals[/b] - passive and usually offer some service, like an item shop.
