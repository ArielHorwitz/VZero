# TODO

## Desired Features
- Prolonged effects / buffs
  - Or delayed effects to allow temporary buffs (buff then debuff)
- Aura effects: method `uids_in_radius` for aoes and auras
  - Map features: foundtains, shops (using auras)
- More varied enemies and behaviors
  - Better spawning, territory agency bias
- Real time-translations: methods `ticks2ms`, and `ms2ticks` for Agency and VFX
- Packaging for Windows

## Bugfixes
- Right click hold release should release SFX
- Drawing entire map, hindering performance
- VFX ticks/frames mismatch
  - Also `background` vfx lasts frames instead of ticks
- Spamming ability hotkeys repeats SFX
- Death needs feedback
