# v0.003
- Added changelog ;)
- Added config folder, with settings and balance-related stats in plaintext
- Attack will now set target as preferred and auto attack them.

### Homebrew balance
You may now create new and change existing units and abilities without code!

- All units and their stats have been moved to the `config/unit.bal` file.
- All abilities and their stats have been moved to the `config/abilities.bal` file.
- Beware and make a backup, as misformatting may break game loading.
