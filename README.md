# VZero
VZero is an open-source real-time action game written entirely in Python and [Kivy](https://kivy.org/).

The game is heavily inspired by a DotA2 mod named "Legends of Dota", where one could combine any loadout of the many abilities available (normally each fixed to a single hero). This allows for lots of creativity and discovering "broken" combinations of abilities.
